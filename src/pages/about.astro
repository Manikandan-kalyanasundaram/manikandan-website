            <p>
                From a young age, I found myself drawn to design â€” fascinated by how colors, 
                shapes, and layout could influence how we interact with the world. This early curiosity 
                steadily grew into a <strong>deep-seated passion</strong>, which ultimately led me to pursue a career in 
                UI/UX design in <strong>2023.</strong> What began as a childhood interest has now evolved into a meaningful 
                journey of crafting purposeful, <strong>user-centric digital experiences.</strong> 
            <p>
            <p>
                Since 2023, my focus has been on understanding and addressing <strong>real-world problems</strong> through design.
                I constantly seek challenges that push me to think deeper and design better. Every project I take
                on is not just an assignment, but an opportunity to create intuitive solutions that genuinely <strong>improve 
                users lives.</strong> This craving for real-world impact is what <strong>fuels my creativity</strong> and 
                commitment to user experience.
            </p>
            <strong></strong>
            <p>
                I've worked on over three substantial projects where I was directly involved in identifying user 
                <strong>pain points,</strong> conducting research, and designing thoughtful, user-centered solutions. These projects 
                not only allowed me to apply my design skills but also gave me the confidence to tackle <strong>complex UX 
                    problems with clarity and empathy.</strong> I often supplement my learning with case studies, which keep my 
                design instincts sharp and feed my hunger for impactful work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, Iâ€™m focused on enhancing my skills in <strong>Brand language designs</strong> and
                deepening my understanding of User experience. For further details, hereâ€™s a link to
